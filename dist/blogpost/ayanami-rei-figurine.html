    <h1>Ayanami Rei Figurine</h1>
    <h2>A beautiful figurine printed and painted from scratch</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>I've been a fan of the hit series <span class="font-italic">Neon genesis evangelion</span> for years now. When I
        first watched the show I got into the ride expecting cool robots fighting cool monsters, but boy was I wrong.
        There are no breaks on this one. It's full of lore, (biblical) references and enough psychological trauma to
        fill a mental assylum. When the ride ended, I stepped out feeling depressed and hopeless. And of course, because
        I hate myself enough, I watched it again. I discovered the movies and the rebuilds. I Began understanding the
        trauma and feelings the main characters felt and why they behaved in the way they did. No piece of media has
        influenced my life as much as Evangelion did. I still occasionally watch the show or movies to this day.</p>
    <p>So when I got a 3D resin printer, it came without question that I was going to print one of the main characters.
        I've been into model building for a while now. I have a great interest in armored vehicles, especially the ones
        from World War 2. I love building and painting tanks, and just creating something unique I build myself. It
        keeps the mind fresh, creative, and distracts me from the unstoppable passage of time slowly steering us all
        towards impending doom. I have never painted a figurine so it would be an interesting and new experience.</p>
    <h3>Printing, glueing, and cleaning up</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>Anyways, the printer I got was the Anycubic Photon S. It was on sale and ive been
                looking into getting one since
                model kits and figurines cost a fortune. It was fairly inexpensive and the build plate is pretty small,
                even
                for
                resin printers. It took my a while to get the settings right but eventually I dialed everything in. The
                fidelity
                of the prints are amazing. Each layer is about 50 micron (or 0.05 millimeters) which is ideal for
                miniatures.
                The details you can get out of a resin printer are stunning, especially compared to a more traditional
                FDM
                printer.</p>
            <p>The figurine was printed in 9 parts (and a base) and is about 25 centimeters tall. I printed them hollow
                to save on resin and weight. I didn't have glue specific for resin. Model kits are often made from
                polystyrene and I have a plastic solvent-based glue which literally melts the plastic together.
                Obviously this glue won't work for resin. I wasnt sure wether to use Super glue or an epoxy putty. There
                are
                benefits and disadvantages to both. Epoxy putty doesnt create as strong of a bond as super glue does but
                it will automatically fill in gap lines. Epoxy putty is also fairly expensive and I dont have a lot of
                it. I opted to use superglue instead so that in the event that I mess up, I can easily glue them back
                together again and wont have to throw away the putty.

            <p class="caption">A dry fit of all 9 parts</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Filling in seam lines, and some more cleaning up</h3>
    <p>Naturally the parts wont transition seamless due to my choice of glue so I had to fill in the gaps with my trusty
        AK interactive modeling putty. It's basically a putty that you paint over the part lines, let it dry in for an
        hour or two
        and then sand away the excess. I haven't found exact drying times for this putty. I have heard someone say you
        need to let it dry for 12 hours, but the putty already feels dry to the touch after a few minutes. Waiting 12
        hours between every application is just too long. I did this a few times to make sure I filled every hole and
        seam line and running my finger over the surface to make sure everything felt smooth. Bumps on the surface,
        caused by support material needed for the print, were simply removed with a hobby knife or sanded away. Now the
        thing with resin is is that it is extremely toxic. Its mandatory to wear a dust mask when sending resin to avoid
        getting any resin particles in your lungs. an FFP2/N95 mask will do but I personally used an FPP3/N99 mask just
        to be on the safe side.

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>After I felt like it was ready for painting, I primed it with AK interactive white primer and
                microfiller. And boy was that a mistake. Normally I use Mr.Hobby' Mr.Surfacer 1200
                <span class="subtext">(which is objectively the best primer)</span>
                but I didnt have it in white. I wanted to test out new primers as well and im a big fan of AK's
                products, so I decided to give them a test. It was advertised as airbrush ready which would make life
                more convenient for me. Yeah not really. It's awfull. The coverage is bad. It's way too thin for an
                airbrush
                so I got spidering when spraying, and it wont clean up unless you use their special product, which I
                didnt
                have and didnt want to buy. After a bit of elbow greese I eventually got it out but god damn it left a
                really bad
                taste in my mouth. I am now stuck with 3 bottles of this garbage. I immediately ordered a bottle of
                Mr.Finishing surfacer 1500 white after
            </p>
            <p>
                After I primed I pre-shaded the underside of the model with AK Real color Dunkelgrau. Dunkelgrau is
                basically a German grey. It's is easily one of the most versatile colors out there. It can be used for
                steel chipping, a rubber-like color, and pre-shading/color modulation. It's easily one of my favorite
                colors which I use in almost every project. Now I was so used to using Dunkelgrau, or German grey for
                shading that I made a big mistake doing so. Its too dark for white. And ironically, I have a bottle of
                light grey which I couldve used and would have saved me a lot of time. I was planning to spray another
                layer of white over to blend in the shading but because I used dunkelgrau, it took a lot more layers to
                get the result I was aiming for.

    <h3>Painting time!</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>The last thing I airbrushed was the Lance of Longinus. I was going to paint the rest with a brush and had
                to paint some other parts in the same color so I used Vallejo's Model Color flat red, diluted about
                50/50 with water and an air pressure of 15-20 PSI. I rarely paint with a brush because well... Airbrush
                is king. So I didn't knew a lot of techniques and wasn't used at using a paint brush at all. I didn't
                have any colors for brush painting either so I had to buy a whole bunch of Vallejo's model colors. In
                theory I could use the lacquer paints I use for airbrushing, but they're not really ideal.</p>
            <p>The rest was painted with a brush. I went back and forth with colors and white a lot to clean up slip-ups
                I made. Of course, the white from Vallejo is different from the white I sprayed earlier so I had to
                blend them a bit as well. Its not that noticable but I know its there and I wont be able to unsee it if
                I don't blend it. The colors I used here are all from Vallejo's Model Color range. The "should pad"
                thingies are painted with bright orange straight from the pot. The inside of the gloves are a mix of
                white and flat blue. You could use maybe use azure blue but I didnt have it. The collar and
                clitoris-looking thing on her chest are... Weird. They differ between reference photo's from a dark red,
                to a more copper looking color. I decided to mix a bit of flat red with orange to get a copper-like
                tone and added more orange to the mix as I went lighter with the shading.</p>

    <p>Now its time for enamels. I love enamels. Theyre so easy to use and forgivable for when you make
        mistakes. Now, being the neanderthal I am, I didnt apply a protective layer of varnish before I starting
        with enamels. Which was a mistake. I simple diluted a little bit of Abteilung 502 black with a lot of white
        spirit to make a pinwash. I have pre-made washes but homemade oil washes provide much more control in how much
        surface tension you want. You simple load up your brush with your mixture and lightly tap the recessed areas and
        "panel lines" and the paint will smoothly flow in by itself due to the surface tension. The white spirit
        evaporates and youre left with clean lines. Now it takes a lit bit of cleaning up with white spirit to remove
        paint on parts where you don't want them. Now this is also why you apply a layer of varnish before starting with
        enamel paints. Because if you apply too much force, even enamel thinner or white spirit can rub off acrylic
        paint.</p>
    <h3>The 'pain' in 'painting'</h3>
    <p>Oh my god. Painting the face took at least half a day. It was painful. The file to print this is free to use and
        publicly available. And you can see other people's attempts at painting them. And lets just say....
        <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/prints/3d-print-rei-ayanami-neon-gensis-evangelion-40-cm-figurine-10921">most
            of them aren't that great.</a> Now, im not an expert myself, far from it. but please at least thin your
        paints. Now I want to avoid falling into the same pitfalls as other painters so I really, REALLY took my time
        paint the head. Since a face that looks wrong and falls into the uncanny valley is immediately obvious</p>
    <p>A wet palette came into clutch here. Of course since I rarely brush paint I didnt have one. So I opted to get the
        Army Painter wet palette. I first did the face. Ayanami has a pretty pale skin color, almost white. Skin color
        is also a tricky color to get right. I decided to take vallejo's light flesh and mix it with some white. Add
        more white for highlights and using pure flat flesh for the darker parts. I didn't want to shade too much since
        anime characters are shaded pretty flat. I wasn't sure what to do with the lips so I just went heavier with the
        shading to make it stand out more.</p>
    <p>Now the eyes. This head is small. Really small. And the eyes? Even smaller. Getting the eyes right is essential
        to avoid falling into the uncanny valley pit. This took <span
                class="font-weight-bold">2 to 3 hours to paint. PAINt.</span> For the iris I went with a mix between
        flat red and cavalry red to get a slightly darker, ruby-like shade. I placed a black dot in the middle for the
        pupil and placed some white dots over the iris for that typical anime-esque highlight. Painting the lashes was
        nerve-wrecking because one mistake could fuck up the entire eye. In hindsight, I probably should've dont it
        before I painted the eye. But oh well it is what it is.

    </p>
    <p>For the hair I used flat blue mixed with white again. I started with a darker shade and worked my way up with
        lighter shades for highlights and where the light would naturally hit. Unfortunately, some print lines are
        visible on the face, and I did not want to send them away because I was scared of fubar-ing it, since the face
        is a pretty delicate piece. These aren't brush strokes I swear leave me alone MOM I KNOW WHAT IM DOING

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>With the face and body painted, the only thing I have left to do was paint the base. Now I printed this
                long after I printer the rest and completely forgot I printed everything at 80% scale. So I had to print
                it 3 times until I got the scale right because I have brain rot. The base was primed with Mr.Hobby'
                Mr.Finishing surfacer 1500 white I ordered earlier. And oh my god spraying that compared to the other
                primer is pure sex. It went on flawlessly. 10/10</p>
            <p>The raised parts where painted by hand with flat red. it took a few layers to get a consistand red color
                across the entire thing but eventually I got it looking close enough, and after drying it should look
                pretty flat.</p>
            <p>And with the base finished. its pretty much done. I applied a layer of AK RC satin varnish over
                everything to protect everything. I feel like I should have used a more glossy varnish but fuck it.
                We're done when I say
                we're done.</p>

    <h3>Closing words</h3>
    <p>I know its far from perfect, but then again, its my first time painting a figurine and basically my first time
        painting with a brush. For a first try I think it looks pretty great and im satisfied with the final outcome. I
        already planned a Misato Katsuragi figurine and as of writing this all the parts are already printed.</p>
